# Warehouse-Model
This script manages a simple database or warehouse of a store.

Customers can select the products that they want to purchase and their corresponding quantities, and a receipt will be generated for them. All receipts will automaticlly be saved in a 'Receipts' folder.

The warehouse will be updated after each purchase. Administrators can manually update the warehouse or add new products as well, after entering their name as "admin" and their password.

At the end of each day, a daily sales report will be generated that can be viewed by the administrator. These reports will also be automatically saved in the 'Reports' folder.
